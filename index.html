    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>My career mission is to be the future of computer hardware. I enjoy working with technology and enjoy working with my hands. In addition to that, I am good at math, so naturally my dream job is Computer Engineering. I want a job that I can have fun with and make gaming PCs that others can have fun with too.</p>
